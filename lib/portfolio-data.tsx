Super solid technically, whether it's frontend or backend, he just gets things done.
But honestly, what I'll remember most is how easy and fun it was to work with him. Always positive, always helpful, and the kind of person who makes the team better just by being there. Great developer, even better human.
Any team would be lucky to have him.`,

Aatif is an amazing team member, always ready to help others, share knowledge and support the team without hesitation. He is exceptionally likeable, easy to work with and brings a composed presence that makes a huge difference during high pressure situations.

I strongly recommend Aatif for any senior engineering or architectural role. His combination of technical strength, ownership and supportive leadership makes him a valuable asset to any organisation.`,

His expertise in modern tech stacks such as NodeJS, NextJS, MongoDB, TypeScript, and the broader JavaScript ecosystem is excellent, and he can always be relied on for clear and accurate technical clarification. He is highly committed to his deliverables and is extremely dependable. In all our time working together, I've never seen a project under his ownership face unnecessary escalations.

I would strongly recommend him to lead and contribute to any project involving modern technology and scalable solutions.`,
